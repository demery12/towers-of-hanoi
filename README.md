# towers-of-hanoi
A data visualization of the classic algorithm

Built with javascript+d3

Features:
* autocomplete
* remembers previous states when you switch to other numbers
* colors stay the same as the blocks move around

Built for fun and to reacquaint myself with d3.

You can see it in action [here](http://dylan-emery.com/towers/index.html)
